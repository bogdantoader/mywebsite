I am a second year DPhil student in mathematics at 
the University of Oxford as part of: 

 * [InFoMM](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/industrially-focused-mathematical-modelling-epsrc-cdt): Centre for Doctoral Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling
 * [Numerical Analysis Group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis)


<br/>

My research is in grid-free compressed sensing/super-resolution, and I am supervised by 
[Prof Jared Tanner](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/tanner/) and 
[Dr Andrew Thompson](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/thompson/). The industrial parter for my research project is the 
[National Physical Laboratory](http://www.npl.co.uk/).

<br/>

Previously, I received a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from 
the University of Manchester, and I worked for a total of three years
in the software industry in London.
